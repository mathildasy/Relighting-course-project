# Relighting-course-project
This is the group project for EIE4512 in CUHK-SZ

Image relighting task of transferring illumination conditions between two images offers an interesting and difficult challenge with potential applications in photography, cinematography, and computer graphics.


- Our approach is a simple but efficient image processing based method and its results in grayscale are visually satisfying.

- Our approach does not rely on any pre-processed reflection map or training.

- Our approach provides a new direction for future image processing of colored images.
